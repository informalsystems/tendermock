Testing ABCI and ABCI++ by mocking Tendermint

## Regenerating protobuf code
The code was generated by running, in https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/main/proto, the command:
```
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. --python_out=../../tendermock --grpc_python_out=../../tendermock $(find . -iname "*.proto")
```
To run this, it is also necessary to put the `https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/gogoproto/gogo.proto` file in the `tendermind/proto/gogoproto` directory (and to create that directory).
Further, [grpc_tools](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/) need to be installed
