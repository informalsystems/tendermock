# tendermock
Testing ABCI and ABCI++ by mocking Tendermint

## Regenerating protobuf code
The code was generated by running, in https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/main/proto, the command:
```
python3 -m grpc_tools.protoc -I. -I../third_party/proto --python_out=../../tendermock --grpc_python_out=../../tendermock $(find . -iname "*.proto")
```
To run this, it is also necessary to put the `https://github.com/gogo/protobuf/blob/master/gogoproto/gogo.proto` file in the `tendermind/proto/gogoproto` directory (and to create that directory).
Further, [grpc_tools](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/python/quickstart/) need to be installed 

# Preparing the docker image

Initializing the chain

Start a docker container (I think this command could be different. I just wanted a command to keep the container alive while I manipulate the file system):

`docker run -p 23456:26658 simapp simd start --with-tendermint=false --transport=grpc --trace`

Initialize the node:

`docker exec b9 simd init node --chain-id tendermock`

Create keys for users (could provide more things on the command line, right now it's interactive and one needs to press enter some times and enter a pw):

`docker exec -it b16 simd keys add node1 -i`

`docker exec -it b16 simd keys add node2 -i`

This will return some addresses, which can be worth saving. For example,
```
address: cosmos1true75k5hh0s94hxa7s8w29ys65s4u9n8g5fh5
  name: node1
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"Ay4/Hi8fX+CIVqSIHBE9n9k0TfzdtFtTwcrKJc1qo2w3"}'
  type: local

Next, add genesis accounts (stake is the name of the coin on the simd app):

`docker exec -it b9 simd add-genesis-account cosmos134r9s82qv8fprz3y7fw5lv40yuvsh285vxev02 5000000000stake`

Add a genesis transaction that sets up a validator:

`docker exec b9 simd gentx --name node1 --amount=5000000000stake`

Add the genesis transaction to genesis.json:

`docker exec b9 collect-gentxs`

Now, pull `genesis.json` from the container:

`docker exec b9 cat /root/.simapp/config/genesis.json > genesis.json`
